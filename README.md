# Database Transactions
#### A Python script that models an in-memory database with transaction support.

To run this code on your machine:
1. Ensure that you have [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone this repo locally using `git clone` 
3. In your command prompt, navigate to the parent diretory and run this command:
- *Windows*
`python ./index.py`
- *Linux/MacOS*
`python3 ./index.py`
4. The script should immediately execute

#### Write-up for future assignment modifications
In the future, I think that a method that retrieves all the data currently stored in the database could be implemented. This method could be an extension of get(), as it currently only checks for the existence of a single key-value pair. By adding this, there would be further proof that the methods were implemented correctly.
